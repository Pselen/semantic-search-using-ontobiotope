Rapid detection of eight causative pathogens for the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis by real-time PCR.
We aimed to detect causative pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collected from patients diagnosed with bacterial meningitis by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In addition to Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae described previously, five other pathogens, Neisseria meningitidis, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes, were targeted, based on a large-scale surveillance in Japan. Results in CSF from neonates and children (n=150), and from adults (n=18) analyzed by real-time PCR with molecular beacon probes were compared with those of conventional culturing. The total time from DNA extraction from CSF to PCR analysis was 1.5 h. The limit of detection for these pathogens ranged from 5 copies to 28 copies per tube. Nonspecific positive reactions were not recognized for 37 microorganisms in clinical isolates as a negative control. The pathogens were detected in 72.0% of the samples by real-time PCR, but in only 48.2% by culture, although the microorganisms were completely concordant. With the real-time PCR, the detection rate of H. influenzae from CSF was high, at 45.2%, followed by S. pneumoniae (21.4%), S. agalactiae (2.4%), E. coli (1.8%), L. monocytogenes (0.6%), and M. pneumoniae (0.6%). The detection rate with PCR was significantly better than that with cultures in patients with antibiotic administration (chi2=18.3182; P=0.0000). In conclusion, detection with real-time PCR is useful for rapidly identifying the causative pathogens of meningitis and for examining the clinical course of chemotherapy.

[Value of protein array in the diagnosis of Helicobactor pylori infection in children].
To study the value of multiple Helicobacter pylori (H.pylori) antibody detection by protein array in the diagnosis of H.pylori infection in children.
Biopsy specimens obtained by gastroscopy from 120 children with digestive system symptoms were detected by rapid urease test (RUT) and modified Giemsa staining. Positivity in both RUT and Giemsa staining was the "gold criterion" of H.pylori infection. Serum samples of these patients were obtained and the antibodies against cytotoxin associated gene A protein (CagA), vacuolating toxin A (VacA), urease, heat shock protein 60 (Hsp60) and RdxA (nitroreductase) were detected by protein array technique.
H.pylori infection was identified according to the "gold criterion" in 60 children. Compared with the "gold criterion", the goodness of fit and the coefficient of contingency in the diagnosis of H.pylori infection of the following four groups antibody detection were all statistically significant (P<0.001): anti-Ure antibody alone, anti-Ure antibody combined with anti-CagA antibody, anti-Ure antibody combined with anti-VacA antibody and anti-Ure antibody combined with anti-CagA and anti-VacA antibody. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the detection of anti-Ure antibody combined with anti-CagA antibody for the diagnosis of H.pylori infection were 81.7%, 91.7% and 86.7%, respectively. The antibody detection showed a high positive predictive value (90.7%) and a high negative predictive value (83.3%).
The antibody detection by protein array, especially the detection of anti-Ure antibody combined with anti-CagA antibody, is valuable in the diagnosis of H.pylori infection.

Clinical factors associated with development of severe-complicated Clostridium difficile infection.
Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) can cause life-threatening complications. Severe-complicated CDI is characterized by hypotension, shock, sepsis, ileus, megacolon, and colon perforation. We created a model to identify clinical factors associated with severe-complicated CDI.
We analyzed data from 1446 inpatient cases of CDI (48.6% female; median age, 62.5 years; range, 0.1-103.7 years) at the Mayo Clinic from June 28, 2007, to June 25, 2010. Patients with severe-complicated CDI (n = 487) were identified as those who required admission to the intensive care unit or colectomy, or died, within 30 days of CDI diagnosis. Logistic regression models were used to identify variables that were independently associated with the occurrence of severe-complicated CDI in 2 cohorts. One cohort comprised all hospitalized patients; the other comprised a subset of these inpatients who were residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota to assess the association of comorbid conditions with the development of severe-complicated infection in a population-based cohort. The linear combinations of variables identified by using logistic regression models provided scores to predict the risk of developing severe-complicated CDI.
In a multivariable model that included all inpatients, increasing age, leukocyte count >15 × 10(9)/L, increase in serum level of creatinine >1.5-fold from baseline, and use of proton pump inhibitors or narcotic medications were independently associated with severe-complicated CDI. In the secondary analysis, which included only patients from Olmsted County, comorbid conditions were not significantly associated with severe-complicated CDI.
Older age, high numbers of leukocytes in blood samples, an increased serum level of creatinine, gastric acid suppression, and use of narcotic medications were independently associated with development of severe-complicated CDI in hospitalized patients. Early aggressive monitoring and intervention could improve outcomes.

A large outbreak of Salmonella Paratyphi A infection among israeli travelers to Nepal.
In Asia, Salmonella Paratyphi A is an emerging infection, and travelers are increasingly at risk. During October 2009-November 2009, an outbreak in S. Paratyphi A infection was noted in Israeli travelers returning from Nepal.
An outbreak investigation included a standardized exposure questionnaire admitted to all patients and medical chart abstraction. Isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE).
During 1 October 2009-30 November 2009, 37 Israeli travelers returning from Nepal were diagnosed with S. Paratyphi A bacteremia. All 37 case isolates had an identical pattern on PFGE, and all were nalidixic acid resistant. Only 1 food venue was frequented by all the outbreak cases, with the largest number of exposures occurring around the Jewish New Year. All patients recovered without complications. Time to defervescence in 17 patients treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin combination was 3.2 days (± 1.7), whereas in 13 cases treated with ceftriaxone monotherapy, the time to defervescence was 6.6 days (± 1.8; P < .001).
A point-source, "Paratyphoid Mary"-like outbreak was identified among Israeli travelers to Nepal. Combination Ceftriaxone-Azithromycin therapy may provide a therapeutic advantage over monotherapy, and merits further clinical trials.

Natural history of colonization with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE): a systematic review.
No published systematic reviews have assessed the natural history of colonization with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). Time to clearance of colonization has important implications for patient care and infection control policy.
We performed parallel searches in OVID Medline for studies that reported the time to documented clearance of MRSA and VRE colonization in the absence of treatment, published between January 1990 and July 2012.
For MRSA, we screened 982 articles, identified 16 eligible studies (13 observational studies and 3 randomized controlled trials), for a total of 1,804 non-duplicated subjects. For VRE, we screened 284 articles, identified 13 eligible studies (12 observational studies and 1 randomized controlled trial), for a total of 1,936 non-duplicated subjects. Studies reported varying definitions of clearance of colonization; no study reported time of initial colonization. Studies varied in the frequency of sampling, assays used for sampling, and follow-up period. The median duration of total follow-up was 38 weeks for MRSA and 25 weeks for VRE. Based on pooled analyses, the model-estimated median time to clearance was 88 weeks after documented colonization for MRSA-colonized patients and 26 weeks for VRE-colonized patients. In a secondary analysis, clearance rates for MRSA and VRE were compared by restricting the duration of follow-up for the MRSA studies to the maximum observed time point for VRE studies (43 weeks). With this restriction, the model-fitted median time to documented clearance for MRSA would occur at 41 weeks after documented colonization, demonstrating the sensitivity of the pooled estimate to length of study follow-up.
Few available studies report the natural history of MRSA and VRE colonization. Lack of a consistent definition of clearance, uncertainty regarding the time of initial colonization, variation in frequency of sampling for persistent colonization, assays employed and variation in duration of follow-up are limitations of the existing published literature. The heterogeneity of study characteristics limits interpretation of pooled estimates of time to clearance, however, studies included in this review suggest an increase in documented clearance over time, a result which is sensitive to duration of follow-up.

[Experimental and clinical studies of flomoxef in the field of obstetrics and gynecology. Representative Committee Members of the Research Team for Infections in the Field of Obstetrics and Gynecology].
Flomoxef (FMOX) has a broad antibacterial spectrum against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria; especially its potent antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus is a significant advantage that may not be found with other cephem compounds. In our determination of its antibacterial potency against various clinical isolates obtained from clinical materials (amniotic fluid, intrauterine secretions, exudates of the pelvic dead space) of patients with various infections, we obtained results representing specific features of this drug. From the results, the drug may be expected to produce an excellent effect in the treatment of various infections. Our study on drug concentrations in body fluids and genital tissues demonstrated a good transfer of this drug into various tissues; in every tissue examined, the drug administered by the usual method in the usual dose yielded a concentration exceeding MIC for principal pathogens, thus promising a good clinical response. Indeed a high clinical efficacy rate of 90.1% (good to very good responses) was obtained in a clinical trial involving 222 cases. Administration of the drug in 2 g quantity daily produced a high response rate of 92.8%. It was especially noteworthy that a good response was obtained in 30 of 32 cases (93.8%) in which other cephem compounds had failed. In evaluation of the bacteriological effect, furthermore, the drug showed an excellent rate of bacterial elimination. In conclusion, this drug is expected to be greatly useful in the light of its good transfer into genital tissues and its strong antibacterial activities against Gram-positive cocci, Gram-negative bacteria and anaerobes as well as against multiple bacterial infections predominating among women with genital infections.

Recurrence of Pelecypod-associated cholera in Sardinia.
From Oct. 30 to Nov. 7, 1979, 10 people in the Sardinian province of Cagliari had onset of bacteriologically confirmed cholera. Two symptom-free excretors of Vibrio cholerae O:1 were detected in household contacts of the patients. There were no deaths. All but 1 of the 12 people with V. cholerae O:1 infection gave a history of recent consumption of marine bivalves known locally as arselle (pelecypods). Triplicate matched neighbourhood controls for each of the first 7 cases identified were also interviewed; none had recently eaten arselle. V. cholerae O:1 was also recovered from samples of water and bivalves obtained from a lagoon on the outskirts of the city of Cagliari. Arselle had also been implicated as the vehicle of transmission in 1973 in the last outbreak of cholera in Sardinia. It seems unlikely that cholera transmission had persisted locally in the interim.

Amino acid requirements of strains of Chlamydia trachomatis and C. psittaci growing in McCoy cells: relationship with clinical syndrome and host origin.
The effects of omission of individual amino acids from growth medium on the multiplication of a range of Chlamydia trachomatis and C. psittaci strains in cycloheximide-treated McCoy cells have been assessed. Differences in requirements were revealed which for C. trachomatis strains correlated with clinical syndrome and for C. psittaci with host origin. All 11 strains of C. trachomatis examined showed a requirement for addition of histidine to the medium; this was not shown by any of four C. psittaci strains. Among the strains of C. trachomatis, three from cases of trachoma, representing serotypes A, B and C, showed a distinctive requirement for the addition of tryptophan to the medium, whilst six strains of oculogenital origin, representing serotypes D-I, exhibited no requirement for tryptophan or methionine; a lymphogranuloma venereum and a 'fast variant' strain both showed a requirement for methionine. Of the four C. psittaci strains from different hosts, three showed distinct patterns of amino acid requirements. All chlamydiae required the addition of valine to medium and the majority required leucine, phenylalanine and also glutamine.

[The effect of omeprazole on healing of duodenal ulcers, Helicobacter pylori and gastritis].
Losec (omeprazole) Astra Co. is a blocker of the proton pump of the parietal cell. It inhibits basal and stimulated HCl secretion. It is used for treatment of gastroduodenal ulcers, reflux oesophagitis and Zollinger Ellison's syndrome. In a group of 17 patients with duodenal ulcers the authors investigated the effect of omeprazole on (1) healing of duodenal ulcers and bulbitis after 2-4 weeks of therapy, (2) elimination of Helicobacter pylori in the antrum, (3) chronic antral gastritis. Ad 1. After two weeks of treatment the authors found that 5 of 17 chronic duodenal ulcers were healed in the remainder substantial regression was found. Four-week treatment led to healing of 16 from a total of 17 ulcers (P < 0.001), i. e. 94%. In subjects with ulcers and bulbitis (12 patients) the ulcer healed in 11 instances, in 7 patients residual bulbitis persisted. Ad 2. H. pylori was detected before treatment in 16 of 17 patients, after treatment only in 5 (P < 0.001). Ad 3. Chronic gastritis was recorded before treatment in all patients. Treatment reduced its activity and the presence of H. pylori.

Respiratory carriage of Kingella kingae among healthy children.
The role of Kingella kingae as an invasive pathogen of young children is being increasingly recognized, but the niche of the organism in the respiratory tract and its prevalence in the normal flora of children remain unknown. To investigate these two aspects throat and nasopharyngeal cultures were obtained every 2 weeks from two cohorts of children, ages 6 to 42 months on enrollment, attending a day-care center in southern Israel. To determine the age-related prevalence of K. kingae, throat cultures were obtained from children ages 6 months to 14 years hospitalized for elective surgery who had not received antibiotics during the previous 30 days and from healthy infants younger than 6 months attending a well-baby-care clinic for routine vaccinations. During an 11-month follow-up 109 of 624 (27.5%) throat cultures but none of the nasopharyngeal cultures obtained from 48 day-care center attendees grew K. kingae. The monthly prevalence of K. kingae ranged from 6.1 to 34.6% with December and April peaks. Overall 35 of 48 (72.9%) children had at least one positive culture for the organism. Among the 27 children who had > or = 2 positive cultures, continuous and intermittent patterns of carriage were observed. None of the colonized children experienced an invasive K. kingae infection. The prevalence of pharyngeal carriage among surgical patients was 8.0%, and the organism was not isolated from any of the infants younger than 6 months attending the well-baby-care clinic.

Non-O1 Vibrio cholerae bacteremia in patients with cirrhosis: 5-yr experience from a single medical center.
To assess the clinical features and susceptibility of cirrhotic patients to non-O1 Vibrio cholerae bacteremia and to provide our therapeutic experiences in this rare and high lethal infection.
Twenty-eight blood culture isolates of non-O1 V. cholerae were identified by our clinical microbiology laboratory between July 1989 and June 1994. Patients with underlying cirrhosis and the aforementioned bacteremia were retrospectively reviewed.
Twenty-one cirrhotic patients (16 male, five female; mean age, 50.9 yr; range 28-67 yr) were identified and classified as Child B (6 cases) and Child C (15 cases). Bacteremic episodes occurred most often from March to September. Seafood ingestion (seven cases) and seawater exposure (two cases) were risk factors, but nosocomial infections were also noted in six cases. Presenting symptoms and signs included ascites (95.2%), fever (81%), abdominal pain (52.4%), diarrhea (33.3%), and cellulitis with bullae formation (19%). Concurrent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis was determined in 10 cases, seven with positive ascites cultures. Antibiotic therapy (either cephalothin with gentamicin or ceftriaxone alone) cured most of the bacteremic episodes. The overall case-fatality rate was 23.8%, but 75% of the deaths were observed in patients with skin manifestation.
Patients with decompensated cirrhosis are susceptible to non-O1 V. cholerae bacteremia and should not ingest raw seafood or expose skin wounds to salt water. A high index of suspicion and early administration of antibiotics may lower the mortality rate.

Previous infection with Helicobacter pylori is the primary determinant of spontaneous gastric hypoacidity in human immunodeficiency virus-infected outpatients.
To investigate the incidence and demographics of gastric hypoacidity among persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 146 asymptomatic subjects were evaluated with use of a radiotelemetry device (Heidelberg capsule). Gastric hypoacidity (minimum gastric pH of > or = 3) occurred in 24 subjects (17%). Demographic characteristics, CD4 cell counts, and Helicobacter pylori serological status were evaluated for an association with gastric pH. Subjects with hypoacidity were more likely to have positive H. pylori serology than were subjects without hypoacidity (15 of 24 vs. 23 of 74, respectively; P = .004). Multivariate analysis indicated that a positive H. pylori serology was the most significant predictor of hypoacidity, accounting for an increase in gastric pH of 39%. A history of injection drug use, heterosexual transmission of HIV, and male gender were also associated with an elevated gastric pH. CD4 cell counts did not contribute to predictions of gastric pH. A history of H. pylori infection is relatively common in HIV-positive black and Hispanic populations and is a predictor of gastric pH.

Genotyping by restriction endonuclease analysis compared to phenotyping by antibiogram for typing methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains colonizing patients in a nursing home.
To assist in defining patterns of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonization in a skilled nursing facility (SNF), we compared genotyping by field-inversion gel electrophoresis (FIGE) restriction endonuclease digestion analysis (REA) with phenotyping by antibiogram for defining strain relatedness among MRSA isolates from SNF patients.
Prospective screening culture surveillance for MRSA among patients in a community SNF.
Nares and stool swab cultures were obtained from newly admitted patients and from all patients quarterly. MRSA were isolated by oxacillin screening agar. Antibiograms were determined by the disk-diffusion method, and genotyping was by FIGE REA.
It was shown that, among isolates with the same genotypes, many had different antibiograms; among isolates with the same antibiograms, many had different genotypes; and the discriminatory indices for isolates of MRSA by FIGE REA and by antibiogram were 0.56 and 0.78, respectively.
Our study demonstrated that, in patients from one SNF, genotyping by FIGE REA identified two prevalent REA DNA types, but with variability of antibiogram patterns within each DNA type; the antibiogram also identified prevalent patterns with variability of REA DNA type within each antibiogram pattern. The discriminatory index of antibiograms alone, or of genotypes alone as determined by FIGE REA, was poor for strains of MRSA isolated from the SNF patients in our study.

Impact of intracranial pressure monitor prophylaxis on central nervous system infections and bacterial multi-drug resistance.
Routine intracranial pressure monitor (ICP) prophylaxis is not practiced at our institution. Nevertheless, some patients receive de facto prophylaxis as a result of the use of antibiotics for injuries such as open or facial fractures. We tested the hypothesis that prophylactic antibiotics do not reduce the incidence of central nervous system (CNS) infections but instead are associated with the acquisition of multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacterial infections.
Patients admitted to the trauma intensive care unit (TICU) from January, 2001 through December, 2004 with blunt, non-operative traumatic brain injury who were managed solely with an ICP monitor were identified from our trauma registry and divided into two groups: (1) Those receiving no antibiotics prior to or during ICP monitoring (NONE; n = 71); and (2) those already receiving antibiotics at the time of ICP monitor insertion (PRO; n = 84). Groups were stratified on the basis of age, Injury Severity Score (ISS), Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) Score, base excess (BE), ICP days, transfusions in 24 h, ICU days, ventilator days, head Abbreviated Injury Score (AIS), and chest AIS. The study groups did not differ with respect to age, ISS, GCS, BE, ICP days, 24-h transfusions, ICU days, ventilator days, head AIS, or length of stay. In all, 183 patients were identified, of whom 28 died within seven days and were excluded from the analysis. All patients were followed until discharge for both CNS infections and subsequent infectious complications.
Only two patients, both in the PRO group, developed CNS infection. Both infectious complications (0.7 vs 1.4 per patient; p < 0.05) and infections secondary to MDR pathogens (0.03 vs. 0.33 per patient; p < 0.01) were significantly more common in the PRO group. Twenty-nine percent of the ventilator-associated pneumonias and 33% of the blood stream infections in the PRO group were MDR, whereas only two blood stream infections in the NONE group (4% of the total infections) were MDR.
The routine use of prophylactic antibiotics for ICP monitor insertion is not warranted. This practice does not reduce the CNS infection rate and is associated with more MDR pathogens in any subsequent infectious complications.

[Changes of pathogens and susceptibility to antibiotics in hematology ward from years 2001 to 2005].
The purpose of this study was to determine the changes of pathogens in hematological ward and susceptibility of patients received chemotherapy to antibiotics. The pathogens were taken from blood, urine and sputum of patients who accepted chemotherapy from years 2001 to 2005, then were isolated and identified. The susceptibility test was performed by disk diffusion method. The results showed that the total of 418 strains were detected. Gram-negative bacteria were the most common of nosocomial infection. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, E. coli account for the most of Gram negative- bacteria infection and most resistant to broad-spectrum penicillin, Acinetobacter baumannii showed a trend of increase. The ratios of gram positive bacteria and fungi were increased slowly, mainly as Enterococcus and Candida. Enterococcus is the most common cause of Gram-positive bacterial infection. Vancomycin resistance did not occur. It is concluded that Gram-negative bacteria are main cause of nosocomial infection in patients with hematological malignancies. Gram positive bacteria and fungi had been more frequent. Strains resistant to antimicrobial agents increase.

Widespread acquisition of antimicrobial resistance among Campylobacter isolates from UK retail poultry and evidence for clonal expansion of resistant lineages.
Antimicrobial resistance is increasing among clinical Campylobacter cases and is common among isolates from other sources, specifically retail poultry - a major source of human infection. In this study the antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates from a UK-wide survey of Campylobacter in retail poultry in 2001 and 2004-5 was investigated. The occurrence of phenotypes resistant to tetracycline, quinolones (ciprofloxacin and naladixic acid), erythromycin, chloramphenicol and aminoglycosides was quantified. This was compared with a phylogeny for these isolates based upon Multi Locus Sequence Typing (MLST) to investigate the pattern of antimicrobial resistance acquisition.
Antimicrobial resistance was present in all lineage clusters, but statistical testing showed a non-random distribution. Erythromycin resistance was associated with Campylobacter coli. For all antimicrobials tested, resistant isolates were distributed among relatively distant lineages indicative of widespread acquisition. There was also evidence of clustering of resistance phenotypes within lineages; indicative of local expansion of resistant strains.
These results are consistent with the widespread acquisition of antimicrobial resistance among chicken associated Campylobacter isolates, either through mutation or horizontal gene transfer, and the expansion of these lineages as a proportion of the population. As Campylobacter are not known to multiply outside of the host and long-term carriage in humans is extremely infrequent in industrialized countries, the most likely location for the proliferation of resistant lineages is in farmed chickens.

Real-time monitoring of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and ammonia (NH₃) emitted by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
We present the real-time monitoring of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) production from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) strains in vitro, using laser-based photoacoustic spectroscopy. Simultaneously, the production of ammonia (NH3) was measured, and the influence of different factors (e.g. the medium, temperature and antibiotics treatment) was assessed. Both reference strains and clinical isolates of patients with CF were studied, and compared to other pathogens commonly present in lungs/airways of CF patients. Hydrogen cyanide production starts to rise as soon as P. aeruginosa bacteria reach the stationary phase ((9.0-9.5) × 10(9) colony forming units, CFUs), up to concentrations of 14.5 microliters per hour (µl h(-1)). Different strains of P. aeruginosa produced HCN to varying degrees, and addition of tobramycin strongly reduced HCN production within 2 h from application. Burkholderia cepacia also produced HCN (up to 0.35µl h(-1) in 9.0  ×  10(9) CFU) while other pathogens (Aspergillus fumigatus, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Mycobacterium abscessus) did not produce detectable levels. Our study reveals for the first time a broad overview of the dynamics of the HCN production in vitro.

The etiologic and epidemiologic spectrum of bronchiolitis in pediatric practice.
To develop a broad understanding of the causes and patterns of occurrence of wheezing associated respiratory infections, we analyzed data from an 11-year study of acute lower respiratory illness in a pediatric practice. Although half of the WARI occurred in children less than 2 years of age, wheezing continued to be observed in 19% of children greater than 9 years of age who had lower respiratory illness. Males experienced LRI 1.25 times more often than did females; the relative risk of males for WARI was 1.35. A nonbacterial pathogen was recovered from 21% of patients with WARI; respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus types 1 and 3, adenoviruses, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae accounted for 81% of the isolates. Patient age influenced the pattern of recovery of these agents. The most common cause of WARI in children under 5 years of age was RSV whereas Mycoplasma pneumoniae was the most frequent isolate from school age children with wheezing illness. The data expand our understanding of the causes of WARI and are useful to diagnosticians and to researchers interested in the control of lower respiratory disease.

Helicobacter pullorum, recently described as sp. nov., is commonly isolated from asymptomatic poultry. Two cases of human enteritis associated with H. pullorum, one of them in an immunocompromised patient, are reported. Problems in the correct species identification by means of phenotypic and genotypic methods are discussed and for the first time a fatty acid pattern of Helicobacter pullorum is presented.
